My name is Waldemar Ortiz-Calo and I am from Carolina, Puerto Rico. My research interests lie within the intersection of theoretical and applied ecology. Currently, my graduate research is focused on understanding the individuality of white-tailed deer moevement ecology across different spatio-temporal scales in Western Missouri. Specifically, I am interested in how individual variation impacts the inferences we derive from our analyses.
